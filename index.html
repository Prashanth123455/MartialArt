        Set up in 1998, Pushpa Raj is a coolie who works to smuggle
        red sanders, a rare wood that only grows in the Seshachalam
        Hills of the Chittoor district in Andhra Pradesh. When DSP 
        Govindappa raids them in the forest, Pushpa hides and recovers
        the stock, thereby gaining the trust of his employer Konda Reddy.
        With the help of novel ideas to smuggle the red sanders, he quickly 
        rises through the ranks and becomes Kondareddy partner

      Mangalam Srinu, a merciless dealer who manages the red sanders 
      syndicate entrusts Konda Reddy to keep 200 tons of his stock safe.
      As Konda's younger brother, Jolly Reddy is deemed incompetent,
      Pushpa is given the job. Govindappa attempts to raid them but 
      Pushpa throws all the logs into the river, saving it from being seized.
       At a party, Pushpa overhears that Srinu is selling the wood at a much 
       higher rate than what they're paid. He asks Konda to demand a fair share
        but backs down as going against Srinu seems risky.

      Pushpa meets Srivalli and instantly falls for her.
       On their engagement day, his half-brother Mohan denies 
       Pushpa's lineage because he was born out of wedlock while 
       his mother is injured in the ensuing scuffle. This angers Pushpa, 
       which motivates him to rise higher in life. The next day, 
       he smuggles the wood to Chennai and meets Srinu from whom 
       he demands ₹1 crore per ton as their share. Srinu refuses 
       and his men attack him but Pushpa overpowers them. He then 
       goes to Chennai himself and cuts a deal to sell the wood at 
       ₹1.5 crore per ton, which Konda and Pushpa agree to share equally

      Jolly blackmails Srivalli to spend a night with him 
      while holding her father captive. Enraged, Pushpa badly 
      beats up Jolly, temporarily paralyzing him. Konda, finding 
      out that Pushpa is responsible for his brother's condition,
       tries to kill him but Srinu's men ambush them. Amid the confusion,
        Pushpa manages to counterattack them. Konda is killed but Pushpa 
        saves Konda's brother Jakka Reddy. He also captures Srinu's brother-in-law 
        Mogileesu and kills him. MP Bhumireddy Siddappa Naidu arranges a truce between
         Pushpa and Srinu and appoints Pushpa to manage their syndicate. After 6 months,
          Pushpa becomes an influential person. Due to Srinu's inability to avenge his brother-in-law, 
          his wife Dakshayini slits his throat which injures him

      While Pushpa is at his prime, a ruthless police officer 
      Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat takes charge as the district's SP. 
      Pushpa offers him a bribe of ₹1 crore. Shekhawat, however, 
      intimidates and ridicules Pushpa for his lineage and threatens
       to shoot his hand if Pushpa doesn't unfold his fingers. 
       Frightened, Pushpa backs down. On the night of Pushpa's wedding,
        Pushpa and Shekhawat drink together. Expressing contempt on how 
        he was ridiculed in their first meeting, Pushpa takes Shekhawat's 
        revolver and shoots himself in his hands. He pressures Shekhawat 
        to get undressed while he also does the same. Pushpa says that his 
        stature as that of a syndicate boss remains the same nonetheless while
         Shekhawat is nothing without his police uniform to the extent that even 
         his dog would not recognize him if he is naked. Pushpa leaves for his 
         wedding while Shekhawat goes back home semi-naked. As predicted, 
         his dog barks at him. In a rage, he kills the dog and burns the bribe money
